I started this blog in 2016 after a conversation with a coworker who blogs. He told me that the best developers are also bloggers. Hence, I dipped my foot into blogging. I didn't stick with it. However, I haven't given up. I have a list of topics I'd like to write about and even some drafts in progress. I hope you find something interesting to read while you're here.
