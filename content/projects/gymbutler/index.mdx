## Precursor

This app started as a simple weight percentage calculator. I built it to quickly find weights needed for workouts. It's built on Angular and hosted [here](https://stephencavender.github.io/ng-percentages-calc/). Source is on [github](https://github.com/StephenCavender/ng-percentages-calc).
